### welcome, fellow human!

Happy that you're joining me here, I have lots of ideas and things I want to create, but currently I'm working on optimizing [get-up](https://github.com/janaabf/get-up), a mobile alarm application, created with React Native and Expo.

**my main tech stack:**

- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- HTML
- CSS (& Emotion)
- Next.js
- React.js
- React Native/Expo
- PostgreSQL
- many more to come :)


If you want to talk about code, or a possible job opportunity hit me up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abfalterer-jana) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/janaabfl)!

Thanks for reading, I hope you're having a great day ‚ú®
